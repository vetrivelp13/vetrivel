Note that, you can create a class only when a course template is created. The registrations will happen only at the class level. The information that you will capture for each delivery type will differ. For example, if the delivery type is ILT or virtual class, you will have to capture information such as date, time, location, and language. In case of online class, you will have to link the content at the class level. A course can have multiple classes of various delivery types. The learner can register for any class and complete the course to receive the credit. </font></td>

As shown in the image, to create a blended course delivery, you will have to first create a course template and then a blended class. While creating a blended course you will need a sequence of classes that the leaner needs to take. The sequencing feature persuades the learner to take the classes only in the sequenced manner. For example, if the sequence is classroom, online, and then virtual class, the leaner will be able to take-up the course only in the prescribed sequence. The learner will not have the option of taking classes of his choice. </font></td>
