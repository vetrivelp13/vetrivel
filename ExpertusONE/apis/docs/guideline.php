  <h3 id="rulesroad"">Developer Rules of the Road </h3>
  <h3>Rules of the Road</h3>
  <p>ExpertusONE maintains a platform that supports the ecosystem. We want to empower our ecosystem partners to build valuable businesses around the information flowing through ExpertusONE. At the same time, we aim to strike a balance between encouraging interesting development and protecting both ExpertusONE's and users' rights.

So, we've come up with a set of Developer Rules of the Road (&quot;Rules&quot;) that describe the policies and philosophy around what type of innovation is permitted with the content and information shared on ExpertusONE.

The Rules will evolve along with our ecosystem as developers continue to innovate and find new, creative ways to use the ExpertusONE API, so please check back periodically to see the most current version. Don't do anything prohibited by the Rules, but talk to us if you think we should make a change or give you an exception.
  
  </p>
  <h3>ExpertusONE Content</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>
  All use of the ExpertusONE API and content, documentation, code, and related materials made available to you on or through ExpertusONE (&quot;ExpertusONE Content&quot;) is subject to and must comply with these Rules. As a reminder, you and your Service are subject to the ExpertusONE Terms of Service.
  </li>
  <li>You may use the ExpertusONE API and ExpertusONE Content in connection with the products or services you provide (your &quot;Service&quot;) to search, display, analyze, retrieve, view, and submit information to or on ExpertusONE. You may use the ExpertusONE name or logos and other brand elements that ExpertusONE makes available in order to identify the source of ExpertusONE Content (&quot;ExpertusONE Marks&quot;) subject to these Rules.</li>
  <li>Your use of the ExpertusONE API and ExpertusONE Content are subject to certain limitations on access, calls, and use as set forth in the Rules, on dev.ExpertusONE.com, or as otherwise provided to you by ExpertusONE. If ExpertusONE believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limitations, your ability to use the ExpertusONE API and ExpertusONE Content may be temporarily or permanently blocked. ExpertusONE may monitor your use of the ExpertusONE API to improve the ExpertusONE service and to ensure your compliance with these Rules. </li>
  <li>You will not attempt or encourage others to: </li>
  
		  <ul>
		  <li>remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on the ExpertusONE API or ExpertusONE Content;</li>
		  <li>use or access the ExpertusONE API for purposes of monitoring the availability, performance, or functionality of any of ExpertusONE's products and services or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes; or</li>
		  <li>use ExpertusONE Marks in a manner that creates a sense of endorsement, sponsorship, or false association with ExpertusONE. You may not use ExpertusONE Marks as part of the name of your company or Service, or in any product, service, name field or logos created by you. All use of ExpertusONE Marks, and all goodwill arising out of such use, will inure to ExpertusONE's benefit.</li>
		  <li>use or access the ExpertusONE API to aggregate, cache or store place and other geographic location information contained in ExpertusONE Content.</li>
		  </ul>
  <li>Your Service may be an application or client that provides major components of a ExpertusONE-like end user experience (a &quot;Client&quot;). An example of a Client is a downloadable application that displays user data and allows users to search for catalogs. If so, certain additional terms apply, including: </li>
  
  			<ul>
  			<li>Your Client must use the ExpertusONE API as the sole source for features that are substantially similar to functionality offered by ExpertusONE. Some examples include trending topics, who to follow, and suggested user lists.</li>
  			<li> You may not pay, or offer to pay, third parties for distribution of your Client. This includes offering compensation for downloads (other than transactional fees), pre-installations, or other mechanisms of traffic acquisition.</li>
  			<li>Your Client cannot frame or otherwise reproduce significant portions of the ExpertusONE service. You should display ExpertusONE Content from the ExpertusONE API.</li>
  			<li>Do not store non-public user profile data or content.</li>
  			<li>You may not use ExpertusONE Content or other data collected from end users of your Client to create or maintain a separate status update or social network database or service.</li>
  			</ul>
  	<li>You do not have a license to ExpertusONE Content submitted through your Service other than the rights granted in the Rules. </li>		
  </ol>
  
 <h3>Principles</h3>
 <p>We ask that you and your Service follow four principles: </p>
 <ul>
    <li>Don't surprise users</li>
   <li> Don't create or distribute spam</li>
   <li> Respect user privacy</li>
    <li>Be a good partner to ExpertusONE</li>
 
 </ul>

<h3>Don't surprise users</h3>
<ol> <li>The Display Guidelines are a part of the Rules and provide guidance on how to best convey all the intended information.<br>
 A few highlights:<br>
 Don't edit or revise user-generated content delivered through the API except as necessary due to technical limitations or requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media.</li>
 <li>Get users' permission before:<br>

 Getting data on their behalf. A user authenticating through your application does not constitute consent to send a message.</li>
 <li>Your Service should not:<br>

    use business names and/or logos in a manner that can mislead, confuse, or deceive users. For more information on use of ExpertusONE Marks, see our trademark rules here<br>
 confuse or mislead users about the source or purpose of your application.<br>
      use as its Application Website URL an unrelated URL, a site intended to entice or encourage users to violate our rules, a spam or malware site, or a shortened URL to mask the true destination.<br>
         replicate, frame, or mirror the ExpertusONE website or its design.<br>
        impersonate or facilitate impersonation of others in a manner that can mislead, confuse, or deceive users.</li>
        </ul>
        
   <p>Respect the privacy and sharing settings of ExpertusONE Content. Do not share, or encourage or facilitate the sharing of protected ExpertusONE Content. Promptly change your treatment of ExpertusONE Content (for example, deletions, modifications, and sharing options) as changes are reported through the ExpertusONE API.</p>
   
   
   <h3>Don't create or distribute spam</h3>
   <ol><li>Spam can take many forms. Please abide by the spam rules here.</li>
   <li> Do not mass-register applications. This includes: <br>  
  
    creating tokens/applications for the purpose of preventing others from using or selling those names, or other commercial use.<br>
        using feeds of third-party content to update and maintain accounts under the names of those third parties.<br>
        submitting multiple applications with the same function under different names for the purpose of name squatting.<br>
 </li>
 <li>Do not facilitate or encourage the publishing of:<br>
 links to malicious content<br>
 pornographic or obscene images to user profile images and background images<br>
 </li>
  </ol> 
  
  <h3>Respect user privacy</h3>
  <ol><li>Your Service must display a privacy policy. Clearly disclose what you are doing with information you collect from users.</li>
  <li> Clearly disclose when you are adding location information to a user's data, whether as a geotag or annotations data. Be clear about whether you are adding a place or specific coordinates. If your application allows users to send data with their location be sure that it complies with the best practices found here.</li>
  <li>You should not solicit another developer's consumer keys or consumer secrets especially if they will be stored or used for actions outside of that developer's control. Keys and secrets that are compromised will be reset by ExpertusONE.</li>
  <li>Do not facilitate or encourage the publishing of private or confidential information.</li>
  </ol>
  
    <h3>Be a good partner to ExpertusONE</h3>
    <ol>
   <!--   <li>
     If you display Tweets in an offline context, do so according to the guidelines found here.</li>  -->
 <li> Respect the features and functionality embedded with or included in ExpertusONE Content or the ExpertusONE API. Do not attempt to interfere with, intercept, disrupt, filter, or disable any features of the ExpertusONE API or ExpertusONE service, and you should only surface actions that are organically displayed on ExpertusONE.<br>
        For example, your Service should execute the unfavorite and delete actions by removing all relevant messaging and ExpertusONE Content.</li>
<li> If your application causes or induces user accounts to violate the ExpertusONE Rules (for example, repeatedly posting api calls unneccessarily, etc.), it may be suspended or terminated. We've provided some guidance in our Abuse Prevention and Security help page.</li>
<li> Respect the intellectual property rights of others.</li>
 <li> Do not use the ExpertusONE Verified Account badge, Verified Account status, or any other enhanced user categorization on ExpertusONE Content other than that reported to you by ExpertusONE through the API.</li>
 <li> ExpertusONE may suspend or revoke access if we believe you are in violation of the Rules or the spirit of these principles. If you are suspended, do not apply for or register additional API tokens.</li>
   
    </ol>
    
    <h3>ExpertusONE Functionality in your Service</h3>
    <h3>ExpertusONE Login</h3>
    <p>End users must be presented with the option to log into ExpertusONE via the OAuth protocol. End users without a ExpertusONE account should be given the opportunity to create a new ExpertusONE account as provided by ExpertusONE. You must display the Connect with ExpertusONE option at least as prominently as the most prominent of any other third party social networking sign-up or sign-in marks and branding appearing on you Service. </p>
    
    <h3>2. General</h3>
    <ol><li>
     If you allow end users to create social updates from your own social service or a third party social networking, micro-blogging, or status update provider integrated into the your Service ("Update"), you must also display a prominent option to publish that content (or a link if the Update is not text or longer than 140 characters) to ExpertusONE. Only link back to the same Update or content on the other service if the Update is longer than 140 characters.</li>
 <li> All URLs referencing content in the Update (for example, a web page, photo, video, or text longer than 140 characters) should direct users back to the page where that content is displayed, rather than any interstitial or intermediate page. You can require users to sign-in to access that page, but the content cannot otherwise be restricted from being viewed.</li>
<!--  <li> If your service displays Updates commingled with Tweets, you must ensure that Tweets reference ExpertusONE as the source.</li> -->
    </ol>
    
   <h3>ExpertusONE Identity</h3>
   <p>Once an end user has authenticated via Connect with ExpertusONE, you must clearly display the end user's ExpertusONE identity. ExpertusONE identity includes visible display of the end user's avatar, ExpertusONE user name, and the ExpertusONE "logo" mark. Displays of the end user's followers on your Service must clearly show that the relationship is associated with the ExpertusONE service. </p> 
    <h3>Other Legal Terms</h3>
    <h3>Termination</h3>
    <p>You may terminate any license in these Rules at any time by ceasing your access to the ExpertusONE API and use of any ExpertusONE Content, and deleting all copies of the ExpertusONE API and ExpertusONE Content as described below. ExpertusONE may immediately suspend your access to the ExpertusONE API or any ExpertusONE Content (or if necessary, terminate this agreement with you) at any time, and without notice to you if you breach any term or condition in the Rules or otherwise engage in activities that ExpertusONE reasonably determines are likely to cause liability to ExpertusONE. ExpertusONE may also terminate any licenses hereunder for any reason (including by email to the address associated with your account). ExpertusONE will not be liable for any costs, expenses, or damages as a result of its termination of this agreement. Upon termination of this agreement, you will promptly cease accessing and using the ExpertusONE API and ExpertusONE Content and will delete all ExpertusONE Content and any information derived therefrom and all copies and portions thereof, in all forms and types of media from your Service. Sections 1(4) and V of these Rules will survive the termination of this agreement. </p>
   <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
   <p>You may be given access to certain non-public information, software, and specifications relating to the ExpertusONE API ("Confidential Information"), which is confidential and proprietary to ExpertusONE. You may use this Confidential Information only as necessary in exercising your rights granted in these Rules. You may not disclose any of this Confidential Information to any third party without ExpertusONE's prior written consent. You agree that you will protect this Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that you would use to protect your own confidential and proprietary information of a similar nature and in any event with no less than a reasonable degree of care. </p>
   <h3>3. Ownership; Feedback.</h3>
   <p>3.1 ExpertusONE. You expressly acknowledge that ExpertusONE and its end users retain all worldwide right, title and interest in and to the ExpertusONE Content, including all intellectual property rights therein. You also acknowledge that as between you and ExpertusONE, ExpertusONE owns all right, title and interest in and to the ExpertusONE API, ExpertusONE Marks, and the ExpertusONE service (and any derivative works or enhancements thereof), including but not limited to all intellectual property rights therein. You agree not to do anything inconsistent with such ownership. Any rights not expressly granted herein are withheld. You agree that you will not challenge ExpertusONE's ownership of, the validity of any license to use, or otherwise copy or exploit the ExpertusONE Marks during or after the termination of this agreement except as specifically authorized herein. If you acquire any rights in the ExpertusONE Marks or any confusingly similar marks, by operation of law or otherwise, you will, at no expense to ExpertusONE, immediately assign such rights to ExpertusONE. </p>
    <p>3.2 You. As between you and ExpertusONE, you retain all worldwide right, title and interest in and to your Service, excluding the ExpertusONE API, ExpertusONE Marks, and the ExpertusONE Service (and any derivative works or enhancements thereof), including but not limited to all intellectual property rights therein. You may provide ExpertusONE with comments concerning the ExpertusONE Content or ExpertusONE API or your evaluation and use thereof. You agree that ExpertusONE and its designees will be free to copy, modify, create derivative works, publicly display, disclose, distribute, license and sublicense, incorporate, and otherwise use the feedback, including derivative works thereto, for any and all commercial and non-commercial purposes with no obligation of any kind to you. </p>
    <h3>4. Updates.</h3>
    <p>ExpertusONE may update or modify the ExpertusONE API, Rules, and other terms and conditions, including the Display Guidelines, from time to time its sole discretion by posting the changes on this site or by otherwise notifying you (such notice may be via email). You acknowledge that these updates and modifications may adversely affect how your Service accesses or communicates with the ExpertusONE API. If any change is unacceptable to you, your only recourse is to terminate this agreement by ceasing all use of the ExpertusONE API and ExpertusONE Content. Your continued access or use of the ExpertusONE API or any ExpertusONE Content will constitute binding acceptance of the change. </p>
   <h3> 5. Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer.</h3>
    <p>5.1 Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that: </p>
    <ol><li>
